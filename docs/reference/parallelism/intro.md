# Intro

Clio implements network based foreign function interface and a remote function protocol. This protocol is also used to provide parallelism. This protocol can be ported to other languages easily, it is a minimal protocol and easy to implement. Ported to other languages, it will enable Clio to import and use functions from other languages, and it will also enable the host language to import and use any function from any other language that has a port of the protocol.
