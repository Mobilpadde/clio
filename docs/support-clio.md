# Support Clio

Clio is in early stages and isn't production ready yet, but you can help us reach a stable version sooner. There are many ways to support Clio, giving it a star on [github](https://github.com/clio-lang/clio), making a blog post about it, twitting or talking about it and sharing it with others helps us a lot. However, if you want to sponsor Clio, buy us a coffee or help with our development costs you can do it on our [opencollective](https://opencollective.com/clio).
